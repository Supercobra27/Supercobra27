<h1 class="Intro">What's up!</h1>

<strong>Who am I?</strong>

How's it going! I'm Supercobra27, or Cobra for short. Some people call me either Super or Cobra or whatever but thats beside the point. I am currently a student at Queen's engineering
and have decided that now would probably be a good time to teach myself how to program. I've wanted to for a long time and now well... I do have the time! I have a whole list of
things I want to try to do and can't wait to see them come into fruition!

<b>What am I interested in?</b>
<ul>
<li>Web Development [HTML, CSS, you know the drill]</li>
<li>Spigot {Java} Plugin Development</li>
<li>Data Science</li>
<li>UI/UX Stuff</li>
</ul>

But yeah that's a basic summary for now. I'll try to keep this updated!
