# Welcome to my GitHub!
Hello, my name is Ryan Silverberg and I am interested in all things Engineering and Science related.
I love learning new things and will be using GitHub to keep my coding progress stored for public viewing.

I am currently studying Computer Engineering at Queen's University in Kingston with plans on doing a masters.

Yes, that photo is my leg.
