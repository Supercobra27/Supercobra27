# Boring Stuff
Hello, my name is Ryan Silverberg and I am interested in all things Engineering and Science related.
I love learning new things and will be using GitHub to keep my coding progress stored for public viewing.

I am currently studying Computer Engineering at Queen's University in Kingston with plans on doing a Master's in High Performance Computing.

Yes, that photo is my leg.

## Current Random Technical Interests
- ASIC/RTL Design (I like my 3rd year project)
- Data Engineering (cc. SkySweep/NodeAnalyzer)
- Error everything else in STEM
