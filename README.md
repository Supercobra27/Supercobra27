<h1 class="Intro">What's up!</h1>

<strong>Who am I?</strong>

How's it going! I'm Supercobra27, or Cobra for short. Some people call me either Super or Cobra or whatever but thats beside the point. I am currently a student at Queen's Engineering
and have decided that now would probably be a good time to teach myself how to program. I've wanted to for a long time and now well... I do have the time! I have a whole list of
things I want to try to do and can't wait to see them come into fruition!

But yeah that's a basic summary for now. I definitely will not update this ever again.
